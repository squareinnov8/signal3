import { Button } from '@signal3/web';

## Overview

Buttons are used to trigger actions and make choices with a single tap. They communicate actions that users can take and are typically placed in areas like dialogs, forms, cards, and toolbars.

## Use Cases

**When to use:**
- Triggering form submissions
- Navigating to a new page or view
- Opening dialogs or modals
- Confirming destructive actions

**When NOT to use:**
- For navigation that doesn't trigger an action (use Link instead)
- When space is limited (consider IconButton)
- For toggle states (use Switch or Checkbox)

## Variants

### Primary

Use primary buttons for the main action on a page. There should typically only be one primary button visible at a time.

```tsx
<Button variant="primary">Get Started</Button>
```

### Secondary

Secondary buttons are for actions that complement the primary action.

```tsx
<Button variant="secondary">Learn More</Button>
```

### Tertiary

Tertiary buttons are for less prominent actions.

```tsx
<Button variant="tertiary">Cancel</Button>
```

### Destructive

Use destructive buttons for actions that delete data or have irreversible consequences.

```tsx
<Button variant="destructive">Delete Account</Button>
```

## Sizes

Buttons come in multiple sizes to fit different contexts.

```tsx
<Button size="sm">Small</Button>
<Button size="md">Medium</Button>
<Button size="lg">Large</Button>
<Button size="xl">Extra Large</Button>
<Button size="2xl">2X Large</Button>
```

## With Icons

Buttons can include icons to reinforce the action.

```tsx
import { ArrowRight, Plus } from 'lucide-react';

<Button leftIcon={<Plus />}>Add Item</Button>
<Button rightIcon={<ArrowRight />}>Continue</Button>
```

## Loading State

Show a loading spinner when the button action is processing.

```tsx
<Button isLoading>Processing...</Button>
```

## Disabled State

Disable buttons when the action is not available.

```tsx
<Button disabled>Not Available</Button>
```
